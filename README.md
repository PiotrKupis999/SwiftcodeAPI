## General Info
**Swift API** is a lightweight and efficient RESTful backend built using **Spring Boot**.

The application parses SWIFT codes from a provided file, stores them in a database, and exposes four endpoints for retrieving and manipulating the data.

<br>


## Features  


-  **SWIFT Code Parsing**: The application parses SWIFT codes from a provided file and organizes them by headquarters and branches.

-  **Database Storage**: Data is stored in a fast, low-latency database for efficient retrieval.

-  **REST API**: Four key endpoints expose the SWIFT code data, allowing for querying, adding, and deleting entries.

-  **Error Handling**: The API gracefully handles edge cases with clear, informative error messages.

-  **Containerized Application**: The application and database are containerized for easy setup and deployment.



<br>

##  Technologies  

- **Programming Language**: Java 21
- **Framework**: Spring Boot  
- **ORM**: Hibernate with JPA  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito

##  Fast installation  

### 1Ô∏è Run Docker Engine

### 2Ô∏è Run in cmd
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Piotrkupis999/SwiftcodeAPI
cd SwiftcodeAPI
docker-compose up -d
 
```

If you want to see the logs in real-time while the container is running, you can omit the -d flag:

```sh
docker-compose up
 
```

##  How to run instructions

### 1Ô∏è Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/PiotrKupis999/SwiftcodeAPI
cd SwiftcodeAPI
```
### 2Ô∏è Install Required Tools
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed:

- Git (https://git-scm.com/)
- Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Java (https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

### 3Ô∏è Build the Project
```sh
mvn clean install
```

### 4Ô∏è Run the Application with Docker
Now you can start the application using Docker (run Docker Engine before). Run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
This will build the Docker containers and start the PostgreSQL database and the Spring Boot application in the background.

### 5Ô∏è Access the API
Now the API is available at:
http://localhost:8080

### 6Ô∏è Access the PostgreSQL Database
You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using the following details:

| PostgreSQL           |                        |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Host: | localhost  |         
| Port:	  | 5432  |         
| Database Name:	  | swift_db          |      
| Username:   	  | postgres    |      
| Password:	    | password |

You can use any PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin or psql) to connect to the database.

<br>

##  Running Tests
Navigate to the swift-api directory, then:
```sh
mvn test
```

<br>

##  API Endpoints  
###  Task Endpoints  
| Method | Endpoint                                    | Description                                              |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/v1/swift-codes/{swift-code}`              | Get details of a single SWIFT code                       |
| GET    | `/v1/swift-codes/country/{countryISO2code}` | Get all SWIFT codes with details for a specific country  |
| POST   | `/v1/swift-codes`                           | Add new SWIFT code entries                               |
| DELETE | `/v1/swift-codes/{swift-code}`              | Delete swift-code data                                   |

##  Testing the API with Postman

This repository includes a Postman collection:  
üìÅ `postman/SWIFTcodeAPI_voowu.postman_collection.json`

It contains **a total of 25 requests**, organized into folders:

- **Get All Banks By ISO2 Code** ‚Äì 3 requests (`GET`)
- **Get Bank By SWIFT code** ‚Äì 5 requests (`GET`)
- **POST - Add new SWIFT** ‚Äì 6 requests (`POST`)
- **Delete SWIFT code** ‚Äì 4 requests (`DELETE`)
- **Sequence** ‚Äì 7 requests in a logical order (add ‚Üí read ‚Üí delete ‚Üí check absence)

### How to Use?

1. Open Postman.
2. Click **Import** and select the file from the `postman/` folder.
3. Ensure the endpoints are pointing to the correct address (default is `localhost:8080`).
4. Run.
